Appendix A - Command Cheat Sheet

---
A.1 - Mouse

Behaviour is based on the active 'Mouse Tool' mode.
Use the Mouse Wheel to change tool type.
Also, you can press the 'T' or click on the 'tool: ....' menu items.

--- Mouse 'Combo Tool' behavior ---
L - Click on an object NOT selected will select it and unselect all others
L - Hold on an object NOT selected will drag only the object, DRAGS in XY 
L - Hold on an object CURRENTLY selected will drag all, DRAGS in XY
L - Hold on background orbits object in both axes of EXAMINER mode XY

R - Click on object toggles its selection on/off
R - Hold on object DRAGS selected objects in XZ plane (L-R & Up-Down)
R - Hold on background for camera Fly Mode

L+R - Hold on background orbits and ZOOMS in and out Examiner mode XZ

You can switch directly between Examiner mode XZ and XY by
releasing the right button and continuing to hold the left button.

Note that after using FLY mode (R-Hold on background) you will then be
able to use 'Look Mode' with the L-Hold. To exit to Pin Mode use 'Tab'.

--- Mouse Hide and Info tools ---

ALT+H - toggle 'Hide Tool'
R - Click to Hide ALL sub-branches of selected node
L - Click to Show ALL sub-branches of selected node

'~' (Tilda) Default behavior is to toggle on/off selection of all nodes.
    With 'Hide' tool active it will progressively hide by branch level.
    With 'Text Tag' tool active it will hide all tags.
     (For tags, you may first need to press 'Esc' then '~' tilda.)

ALT+I - toggle 'Info Tool'

Right - Click to Hide Text Tag title
Left - Click to Show tag title, additional clicks change display mode

---
A.2 - Keyboard

Note: Numbers, -, +, etc apply to the main keyboard, not the number pad.

A useful 'bug' is to change selection to another object (TAB, New, etc..)
and do this while performing a rotation, it will continue to rotate, also
applies to zoom and translate...

It is possible to press multiple keys at once (3-5 typical depending on the
keyboard and key combo...)  So for example, you can do a rotation and zoom
while simultaneously changing the color.

SHIFT - Reverses some functions, speeds up rotation and translation

ESC - Fullscreen Toggle and also exits console mode (return to Game Mode.)

T - Tool type selection, SHIFT-N for previous tool.

X - change active aXes, for non-uniform scaling, channels, segments

--- Node Creation ---

N - New node, creates nodes, (SHIFT-N to create a new primary torus)
Del - Delete node, deletes active node and all its child branches

--- Pick Active Object ---
Tab - pick Next sibling node, (SHIFT+Tab for previous)

Left arrow - select left sibling (SHIFT+arrow to skip towards first node)
Right arrow - select right sibling (SHIFT skips towards last node)
Up arrow - select child, up a branch level (SHIFT jumps to leaf)
Down arrow - select parent, down a branch level (SHIFT jumps to root)

C - pick Camera, repeat to select next camera
G - pick Grid, repeat to iterate through grids

spacebar - select or unselect currently active object

--- Move Camera or Objects ---

A - decrease X
D - increase X

W - increase Y
S - decrease Y

E - increase Z
Q - decrease Z

--- Rotate (same keys as Move with 'Alt' key held) ---

Alt+A - Left
Alt+D - Right

Alt+W - Up
Alt+S - Down

Alt+E - CW
Alt+Q - CCW

--- Scale ---
Z - Scale objects up (SHIFT+Z for down) based on active aXes 'X'
 -- scaling Z-axis of the root 'G'rid will compact/expand entire scene

--- Topology & Geometry ---
J - Next 'topo' type, SHIFT+J for previous topo.
 -- ALT-J will change the facet (on a cube...)

O (alpha) - Object geometry, does not change the 'topo' type.
R - Ratio sets inner radius of a torus, SHIFT-R to reduce.

Y - Grid Segments, adds (or SHIFT-Y to subtract) 2D and 3D layers
 -- effected by the active aXes (Z axis creates 3D grid layers)

--- Color & Transparency ---

'+' (plus) - next color
'-' (minus) - previous color

9 - less opaque (more translucent)
0 (zero) - more opaque (less translucent)

B - Background color, toggle between black and white
R - Rescale normals toggle, effects lighting of scaled objects
8 - change transparency mode (3 alpha modes + none)

V - Video or Image texture map (SHIFT for previous)

F - Freeze;
H - Hide;

--- Set Points restrict the translate_x/y/z range of an object ---

[ - Low set point, object default is z = 0.0 for ground level.
] - High set point (set points are applied to the active aXes)

--- State Files ---

K - Keep(SAVE) writes a time-stamped ANTzYrMoDaHrMnSe.csv

L - Load CSV file using File Dialog
    ALSO... launches URL as tag title ie: http://example.com or app.exe

1 - Load ANTZ0001....CSV file set (SHIFT+1 to Save)
2 - Load ANTZ0002....CSV
3 - Load ANTZ0003....CSV

--- Scene (hard-coded) Presets ---

4 - Reserved for future VizCode (formally Selcect ALL, now '~' tilda)

5 - Load FileViz of directory tree structure
6 - Load GitViz from github repo (specified in npglobals.csv)

7 - Test Scene (used for to test app for > 100K nodes)

F4 - Take Screenshot, saved to usr/images/antz(timestamp).bmp

--- IO Channels ---
P - Loads and Plays channels data (ANTzCh0001.csv & ANTzChMap0001.csv)
> - Channel Up
< - Channel Down

... Pause and Play animation

--- Browser URL & record_id Retrieval ---
U - Opens Tag title URL in the system browser, supports HTML href="...".
    If no URL in title, then uses default URL with record_id appended.
    Will also open applications and files based on OS default mime type.

--- GUI Console ---
M - Menu display mode (1, 3, or 40 lines, then off)

--- Info Text Tags ---
I - Info toggle for display of Text Tags (Outline Title, Color Title, Desc)

\ (backslash) - Subsamples nodes to draw faster, SHIFT key reverses

--- Database ---
? - Menu Loader for databases, SHIFT+? to Save a time-stamped DB.
; - Load DB update, SHIFT+; to Save an update to the active DB.

--- GUI Console ---
Enter (Return) - enter Command Console for text entry.
Esc  (Escape) - leave text Console and return keybaord to 'Game Mode.'

--- System Console ---
At OS system console type 'antz ?' for help on command line arguements.

--- OSC Setup ---
Edit main 'antzglobals.csv' to set the OSC TX/RX ports and IP.
